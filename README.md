1.	Problem description
      The aim of this project was solving the Capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows, or CVRPTW. 
      The CVRPTW is a type of Vehicle routing problem: a number of vehicles needs to leave the depot, visit customers 
      and return to the depot, a single customer can only be visited by one vehicle, every customer needs to be 
      visited and the end goal is to use as little vehicles as possible, or to have the shortest possible path. 
      A capacitated VRP considers that each vehicle has a capacity, and a VRP with time words considers time intervals 
      when customers can be visited or serviced. In the case of CVRPTW, all vehicles start at the depot at time = 0 
      and must return to the depot before the depotâ€™s due time. They can only serve customers when they are ready and 
      must spend some time servicing a customer. With the addition of both capacity and time windows, the need to 
      optimize this problem is higher.
